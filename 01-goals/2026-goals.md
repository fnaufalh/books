# 2026 Reading Resolution

## Baseline 2025
- Sept: finish `Psycho-Cybernetics` (first full finish after years of partial reads)
- Dec 30: finish `The Richest Man in Babylon`
- Dec 31: finish `The Dip`
- Insight: reading feels lighter now, but I want every book to be useful now or later
- New direction: add fiction, not only non-fiction

## Targets (Proposed)
- Books: 50 target, 25 minimum
- Fiction: at least 3 books
- Non-fiction: focus on books that are actionable or future-useful

## Topics Focus
- Personal growth / mindset
- Finance / wealth habits
- Business / strategy
- Fiction for perspective and empathy

## Habits
- Finish what I start or consciously stop with a short reason
- Read daily (small, consistent sessions)
- Weekly processing: move `inbox/` notes into `04-notes/`

## Principles
- Single source of truth lives here
- Quality over quantity, but maintain steady pace
- Capture insights and actions, not just highlights

## Review Cadence
- Weekly: process notes + update metrics
- Monthly: adjust backlog priorities
- Quarterly: review goals and targets
