## Chapter Notes
When I remember Jung's work, I feel I can do anything.  
I can be my best self, become a form I can barely imagine.  
I don't try to understand his work; I try to live with it and pass through it.

I'm not capable of solving people's problems,  
but I'm the only hope that can help myself out of the darkness  
and keep him conscious.  
Listening to what he wants to express.  
Being there when he faces his struggle.

I'm grateful and happy to live with it.  
I know only a few people who really understand what I'm talking about,  
but I accept that.

-- me, Ignis, Nerio, and other formless selves
