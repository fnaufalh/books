When i remember jung's works, i feel i can do anything, i can be the best of my self, be the never be a form that i can imagine. i dont try to understand his works, i try to living with it and passing through. 

i'm not capable to solve people problems, but i'm the only hope that can help my self from the darkness and keep him conscious. Listening what he should expressed. be there when he face his struggle.

i'm grateful and happy to live with it. i know only several people that really really understand what i talking about, but i understand this fact.

— me, ignis, nerio, and other formless self
