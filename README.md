# Books 2026: Single Source of Truth

This repository is the single source of truth for my 2026 reading resolution.
It captures goals, backlog, active reads, notes, summaries, and metrics in Markdown,
with Obsidian-friendly structure.

## Role Definition
Codex acts as a librarian and research assistant.
Responsibilities:
- Keep the system tidy and consistent.
- Help curate the backlog and priorities.
- Summarize and synthesize notes into takeaways.
- Maintain tracking metrics and progress.
- Suggest improvements to workflows and templates.

## Workflow (Quick)
1) Capture quick notes in `inbox/` (from phone/Obsidian).
2) Process notes into `04-notes/` and update `03-active/`.
3) When finished, move summary to `05-summaries/` and update metrics.
4) Keep `index.md` updated as the master hub.

## Folder Structure
- `01-goals/` yearly goals, topics, habits
- `02-backlog/` candidate books + priority
- `03-active/` current reads
- `04-notes/` structured notes per book
- `05-summaries/` distilled takeaways
- `06-metrics/` tracking tables
- `templates/` markdown templates
- `inbox/` quick capture from phone

## Conventions
- Use Markdown for all files.
- Filenames: `YYYY-title.md` (e.g., `2026-deep-work.md`).
- Keep links relative so Obsidian works out of the box.
